# Ecommerce Sales Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Ecommerce Sales Data Analysis** project! In this repository, we perform a detailed analysis of ecommerce sales data to uncover key insights, trends, and patterns in customer behavior, product performance, and sales metrics. Whether you're an analyst, marketer, or just a data enthusiast, this project offers valuable insights into the world of ecommerce.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze a large ecommerce sales dataset to:
- Explore customer purchase patterns and behavior.
- Identify top-performing products and categories.
- Analyze trends over time, such as monthly sales growth and seasonal variations.
- Generate actionable insights for business optimization.

Through this analysis, we can gain a better understanding of what drives ecommerce sales and how businesses can tailor their strategies to maximize profits.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes, including:
- `OrderID`: Unique identifier for each order.
- `ProductID`: Unique identifier for each product.
- `ProductCategory`: The category the product belongs to.
- `Quantity`: Number of items purchased.
- `Price`: Price per product.
- `Discount`: Discount applied to the product.
- `Sales`: Total sales amount (price * quantity - discount).
- `OrderDate`: Date of the order.
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Country`: The country where the order was placed.

The data allows for analysis across multiple dimensions, such as:
- Customer demographics (if available).
- Product performance by category.
- Regional sales distribution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

This project is built using the following tools:
- **Python**: The programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for creating insightful charts.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An interactive environment for data analysis and visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For basic predictive modeling (optional).

## üîß Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShubhamMvernekar/Ecommerce-sales-data-analysis.git
   cd Ecommerce-sales-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   After installation, launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open the notebook** to explore and run the analysis:
   - Open the `.ipynb` file (e.g., `Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`) in the Jupyter interface.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the raw dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with analysis and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: A file containing all necessary dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file, which gives an overview of the project.

## üîç Key Insights & Analysis

Some of the key analyses and insights included in this project:
- **Sales Trends**: How sales have evolved over time (e.g., monthly and yearly sales trends).
- **Top Products**: Identifying the best-selling products and product categories.
- **Customer Behavior**: Segmenting customers based on their purchasing habits.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Sales distribution across different countries.
- **Discount Impact**: Analyzing the effect of discounts on sales and revenue.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Identifying peak seasons for ecommerce sales and growth patterns.

## üèÜ Example Analysis

### 1. Sales Trends Over Time
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('data/ecommerce_sales.csv')

# Convert OrderDate to datetime
df['OrderDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['OrderDate'])

# Extract Year and Month from OrderDate
df['Year'] = df['OrderDate'].dt.year
df['Month'] = df['OrderDate'].dt.month

# Group sales by Year and Month
monthly_sales = df.groupby(['Year', 'Month'])['Sales'].sum().reset_index()

# Plot the sales trends over time
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(monthly_sales['Year'].astype(str) + '-' + monthly_sales['Month'].astype(str), monthly_sales['Sales'], marker='o')
plt.title('Monthly Sales Trends')
plt.xlabel('Year-Month')
plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

### 2. Top Performing Products
```python
top_products = df.groupby('ProductID')['Sales'].sum().nlargest(10)
top_products.plot(kind='bar', title='Top 10 Best-Selling Products')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales ($)')
plt.show()
```
